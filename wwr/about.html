                    The Whitewater Rafting Site Project is a website project that you will work on throughout the
                    course. The goal of the
                    project is to meet the course outcomes and objectives through development specifications that match
                    learning activities
                    and assignments. You will be involved in the planning, design, development, and deployment of your
                    own whitewater
                    rafting site. Some of the pages have more prescriptive requirements that others, and there will be
                    opportunities for you
                    to demonstrate competency and your own creativity.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Whitewater rafting is a type of recreation that involves navigating a non-motorized watercraft down free
                flowing rivers.
                A rafting company organizes trips, provides the watercraft, life jackets, etc., and typically offers
                experienced guides
                to take passengers down a river. The business intent is to provide a thrilling and safe experience to
                individuals and
                groups for a fee.
